## The Map that saved the city

- London 1854
- deady summer begins
- dozens dying daily.
- nobody knows exact reason.
- theories made: 
	- air smells foul (bad air) (miasma)
	- divine punishment or moral decay
- Dr John Snow, a physician asked "where are people dying" and began collection location data on deaths.
- plots deaths on a city map, representing each death with a small black bar
- overtime, a visual pattern starts to form (a cluster of dots around broad street)
- other areas of city are largely unaffected, questions "what is unique about this location??"
- adds locations of public water pumps to his map.
- discovery: the highest death count surrounds the broad street water pump.
- it was actually cholera, a waterborne disease, spreading through the pump.
- mystery was solved with simple mapping.
